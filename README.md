# BigData
This project contains exercises in Hive, Scala and Spark (in that order) which introduce basic concepts and performance comparisons.

## Hive

This folder contains a single JSON file extracted from a Zeppelin notebook. The notebook itself contains a few basic exercises within Hive along with some information about the various Hive configurations and features. The notebook shows off a few Hive queries run across a Google Dataset of the World Development Index (2016) and compares the performance to running similar queries in a bash window. Please look into the actual JSON file on a Zeppelin instance for more details.

## Scala

Work in Progress.

## Spark
